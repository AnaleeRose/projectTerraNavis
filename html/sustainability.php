            <div class="mainSection-content">
              <p>One of the big questions in regards to an Earthships sustainability is how do you power an off-gridhome? With the advent of so many ways to generate clean, renewable energy, it would seem at firsta daunting task to pick just one! With that being said, there are two primary forms of power generationused in an Earthship, with a third, more controversial option.</p>

              <p>The first and widely accepted best option is solar power. As the design of an Earthship makes it idealfor dry/arid locales solar energy is the most abundant source of renewable energy for Earthships, asthe number of sunny days is higher than that of the national average. The second option, is windenergy in combination with solar, as the winds within a desert setting are not as reliable as that of thesun. Typically wind generated energy is used in conjunction with that of solar power to allow you togenerate your own energy in multiple ways, giving you the option of having power year round. Lastly,the most controversial option is propane or natural gas.</p>

              <p>The principles of an Earthship is to be as close to 100% sustainable as possible, while minimizingwaste. With Propane/Natural gas not being a renewable energy source, it goes directly against theprinciples of an Earthship. One way that this is used as an energy source within an Earthship, ispurely as a form of backup power should a situation arise that negates your ability to generate powerfrom solar or wind.</p>

            <div class="mainSection-content">
      	    	<p>As per part of the design of an earthship, the ability to grow one's own food lends to the self relianceof the design as a whole. Most earthships will have a large windowed area in the front of the structurethat is facing out from the earth mound in which it is set into. This area is typically used as both atemperature buffer and greenhouse.  By having an area of the earthship that gets sun all year round,you have the ability to grow your own food all year round as well!</p>

              <p>One starts by creating a planting area of soil within the greenhouse area of the earthship. Once this is done you can plant your favorite vegetables or fruits and start your journey of food based selfreliance. Even small fruit bearing trees can be planted in some earthship designs! While thegreenhouse area of your earthship serves as a great location for year round growing, you can alsoutilize the surrounding area outside of your earthship during the Spring and Summer months to growadditional or more varied food.</p>

    	    <h3 class="mainSection-heading subheading" data-subheading="three">Water Collection</h3>
            <div class="mainSection-content">
      	        <p>Now we come to one of, if not the most challenging aspects of living in an earthship, where do youget your water from?  With the dry and arid nature of the typical earthships locale, water collectioncan be a daunting task to overcome in order to make earthship living sustainable for the long term.With typical rainfall in this locations being less than 11 inches per year, simple rainwater collection willnot sustain you alone. While rainwater collection should be used to maximize the amount of wateryou are able to bring in, storing this water is even more important as it can sometimes be monthsbetween rainy weather.</p>

                <p>Another way to get water for your earthship is to bring outside water into your earthship via watertrucks or more simply, small portable water containers that you can fill while you are away from yourearthship and then bring back with you. This alone can be a deal breaker for some who areconsidering building/living in an earthship. However, there can be a possible solution to this problemwhen given the knowledge and foresight in the early design phase. When looking for a location tobuild an earthship, firstly finding an underground water source where a well can be drilled should beone of the primary objectives if you do not want to bring in outside water regularly. Not only is haulingwater in a pain, but also costly in the long run, and if it can be avoided, it absolutely should be.</p>

            <h3 class="mainSection-heading subheading" data-subheading="four">Recycling</h3>
            <div class="mainSection-content">
              <p>As resources are finite and sometimes hard to come by at all in the remote locations that you will beliving in, recycling everything you can is a must. Starting with your most scarce resource in anearthship, water.  There are many ways to recycle your grey and even your black water waste withinan earthship. The easiest to recycle is your grey water, which can be stored and reused to flushtoilets and also to water the greenhouse plants within your earthship. The black water, sewer water,can in turn be irrigated into an outdoor garden to fertilize and water the plants.</p>

              <p>As a staple of sustainability in an earthship, vegetables and fruit are a large part of your diet. By usingthe leftovers from vegetables, fruit and plants, you can use those to create compost that will help tofertilize the plants in your greenhouse, rather than using black water recycling to do so allows theodor to be eliminated within the earthships greenhouse area.</p>
